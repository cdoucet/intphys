* for intphys-2.0 release
  Main objective is to replicate intphys-1.0 with the following
  scenarii: apparition/disparition, teleportation, changement de
  texture, changement de forme (en vol ou glissant)

** steps for test O1 [2/4]
*** DONE static visible
    CLOSED: [2018-03-24 sam. 19:15]
- 1 actors
- then up to 3 actors
*** TODO static occluded
- implement check run
- have working occluders
*** DONE dynamic visible
    CLOSED: [2018-04-25 mer. 19:40]
- implement the corridors and force
- implement dynamic check
*** TODO dynamic occluded
** TODO generate and validate a little database
* various bugs [0/2]
** TODO lighting
   - bug: increasing illumination in some scenes (when walls)
   - we want 1 skylight and from 0 to 2 (random) directional lights.
** TODO packaged mode
*** TODO Segmentation fault when more than 10 scenes to generate
Seems to be related to the number of actors spawned but not sure.
*** TODO Fix the code base to run in packaged mode [0/3]
- [ ] depth and mask capture
- [ ] capture in headless mode
- [ ] friction
*** TODO Unexpected crash at startup with
Error: appError called: Assertion failed: ( Y*NumCells.X + X ) < Cells.Num()
[File:Runtime/SlateCore/Public/Input/HittestGrid.h] [Line: 182]
* desired features
** TODO reset the sky sphere rotation between scenes
   - integrate SkySphere as a Pyhton class
** TODO implement different classes of motion
   static, sliding, rolling(?), falling, walking (agent)
** TODO run on a headless cluster
*** The problem is remote openGl rendering
- with DISPLAY=:0 that works remotely but corrupt the host's X server!
- http://www.virtualgl.org can be a solution
*** alternatively update to UE-4.14
- https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/unreal-engine-4-14-released
- New: Added "offscreen" video driver to SDL so the engine can now
  create GL context on headless machines not running any display
  servers (EGL is enough).
