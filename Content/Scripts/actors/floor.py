# Ok here we go: This is a recursive instantiate class.  The general
# principle is to instantiate a class twice to avoid making two
# distinct classes.  I needed to instantiate a python component with
# parameters but UnrealEnginePython wouldn't let me do that.
# Furthermore, I couldn't spawn the actor without instanciate the
# class and thus, I couldn't spawn it with any parameter.

# Let me explain myself : In the main, I call the constructor of the
# class Object (for instance, or Floor, or Occluder), which call the
# __init__ function of Object with at least 1 argument, world which
# call the __init__function of BaseMesh with at least 1 argument,
# mesh_str.  In the Object __init__ function, I call actor_spawn,
# which implicitely instanciate Object (yes, again) BUT during the
# second instantiation, no parameters is given to __init__ (of Object
# and BaseMesh) (this is why there is default values to every
# parameters of __init__).  Thus, if __init__ is called without any
# parameters, I know that it is the second instantiation, so I don't
# spawn the actor again.  Once the object spawned, all I have to do is
# to set the parameters in the second instantiation (location,
# rotation,...).

# Floor is the plane thing which is the ground of the magic tricks.
# It inherits from BaseMesh.


class Floor(BaseMesh):
    """A rectangular plane which is the ground of other actors

    Parameters
    ----------
    world: UEngine world instance
    scale: FVector
        Scale factor (x, y, z) for the mesh, default to (10, 10, 1)
    material: uobject
        Actor's texture, random by default

    You can't pass the location, direction and so on of the floor as
    parameter because it is not needed, I gess.

    If you need it anyway, help yourself. Just for you to know, there
    is a formula in the location to make that the reference point of
    the location is the center of the mesh, not the corner in the left
    back formula = 'the place where you want it to be' - (('size of
    the mesh' * 'scale') / 2 so by default = 0 - (400 * 10) / 2.

    Disclaimer: if you change the size of the mesh, think about
    changing the formula
