"""
Ok here we go:
This is a recursive instantiate class.
The general principle is to instantiate a class twice to avoid making two distinct classes.
I needed to instantiate a python component with parameters but UnrealEnginePython
wouldn't let me do that.
Furthermore, I couldn't spawn the actor without instanciate the class and thus,
I couldn't spawn it with any parameter.

Let me explain myself :
In the main, I call the constructor of the class Object (for instance, or Floor, or Occluder),
which call the __init__ function of Object with at least 1 argument, world
which call the __init__function of BaseMesh with at least 1 argument, mesh_str.
In the Object __init__ function, I call actor_spawn,
which implicitely instanciate Object (yes, again)
BUT during the second instantiation, no parameters is given to __init__ (of Object and BaseMesh)
(this is why there is default values to every parameters of __init__).
Thus, if __init__ is called without any parameters, I know that it is the second instantiation,
so I don't spawn the actor again.
Once the object spawned, all I have to do is to set the parameters in the second instantiation
(location, rotation,...).
Et voilÃ  !


Occluder is the vertical plane thing that sometimes fall and sometimes get up by itself.
Sounds weird, it is.
It inherits from BaseMesh.
The occluder spawns verticaly.

ABOUT the moves variable : it is an array which shall contain the frames when
you want the occluder to initiate a movement (it moves at 1 degree per frame).
ergo, if you want the occluder to move at the first frame, put 0 in the array.
The occluder will come down. If you put 50, it won't have time to fully go
down : it will rise again at the 50th frame
