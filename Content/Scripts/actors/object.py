# Ok here we go: This is a recursive instantiate class.  The general
# principle is to instantiate a class twice to avoid making two
# distinct classes.  I needed to instantiate a python component with
# parameters but UnrealEnginePython wouldn't let me do that.
# Furthermore, I couldn't spawn the actor without instanciate the
# class and thus, I couldn't spawn it with any parameter.

# Let me explain myself : In the main, I call the constructor of the
# class Object (for instance, or Floor, or Occluder), which call the
# __init__ function of Object with at least 1 argument, world which
# call the __init__function of BaseMesh with at least 1 argument,
# mesh_str.  In the Object __init__ function, I call actor_spawn,
# which implicitely instanciate Object (yes, again) BUT during the
# second instantiation, no parameters is given to __init__ (of Object
# and BaseMesh) (this is why there is default values to every
# parameters of __init__).  Thus, if __init__ is called without any
# parameters, I know that it is the second instantiation, so I don't
# spawn the actor again.  Once the object spawned, all I have to do is
# to set the parameters in the second instantiation (location,
# rotation,...).  Et voilÃ  !

# Object is the python component for the main actors of the magic
# tricks (the sphere, the cube, or else).  It inherits from BaseMesh.
